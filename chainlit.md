# GeoFix

**Intelligent geospatial data correction powered by AI.**

GeoFix detects and fixes spatial errors in your datasets — overlaps, boundary violations, road conflicts, invalid geometries, and more.

### Getting Started

1. **Upload** a geospatial file (Shapefile, GeoJSON, or GeoPackage)
2. **Profile** your data quality with automatic analysis
3. **Detect** errors using the built-in QC pipeline
4. **Fix** issues automatically with audited decision-making
5. **Export** your corrected dataset

### Quick Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `profile` | Analyze data quality |
| `detect errors` | Run the full QC pipeline |
| `fix all` | Apply automatic corrections |
| `download` | Export the corrected dataset |

Or just ask me anything — I can help with GIS concepts, coding, and more.
